The University of Groningen (abbreviated as UG;[5] Dutch: Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, abbreviated as RUG) is a public research university of more than 30,000 students in the city of Groningen in the Netherlands. Founded in 1614, the university is the second oldest in the country (after Leiden) and one of the most traditional and prestigious universities in the Netherlands.

The University of Groningen has eleven faculties, nine graduate schools, 27 research centres and institutes, and more than 175-degree programmes. The university's alumni and faculty include Johann Bernoulli, Aletta Jacobs, four Nobel Prize winners, nine Spinoza Prize winners, one Stevin Prize winner, various members of the Dutch royal family, several politicians, the first president of the European Central Bank, and a secretary general of NATO.[6][7][8]

The institution was founded as a college in 1614 in an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden, or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.[9][10][11]

The coat of arms of the university was confirmed by The Estates of the City and County of Groningen in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.

In the first 75 years of its existence about 100 students enrolled every year.[citation needed] Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first rector magnificus, Ubbo Emmius, came from East Frisia in modern-day Germany, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region.[citation needed]

The development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by ‘Bommen Berend’ in 1672.[citation needed] On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period.

During the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administered by the Imperial University of Paris. Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen (Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen). During this time period, it remained the only open university in the Kingdom of Holland.[12] In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. A fire completely destroyed the building in 1906.

In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the ""Rijksuniversiteit Groningen"" (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the university was given a research as well as an educational duty.

The University of Groningen developed during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students grew rapidly. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had grown to 1,000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. In recent times there are about 32,700 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.

In March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the China Agricultural University to establish a campus in the Chinese city of Yantai. This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China.[13] The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by censorship in China.[14] In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the ""insufficient support for the project"".[15]

Key facts and figures about the University of Groningen are:[3]

The university operates under the BSA system, under which a first year undergraduate (bachelor) student must achieve a certain number of ECTS in order to progress to the second year. This varies from 30 ECTS to 45 ECTS among various degrees.[17]

RUG has its own newspaper: the Universiteitskrant.[18]

The university's Center for Information Technology (CIT) houses an IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer and data center of Target used by the LOFAR project as well as a Virtual Reality and 3D-visualisation center.[19]

The RUG has 6,250 employees.[38]

The university library was renovated between 2013 and 2017.[39] The RUG has a branch in Leeuwarden.[40] Plans to establish a ""branch campus"" in China's Yantai were called off in January 2018, and the University Museum is now in the process of being established.[41]

The University of Groningen is represented in the Academic Heritage Foundation, a foundation that aims to preserve university collections and cultural treasures.[42]

The University of Groningen is organized in eleven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, law, economics and business, spatial sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences and technology. Each faculty (cf., College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers bachelor's, master's, PhD, and exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.

Since 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent liberal arts college, University College Groningen (UCG).[43][44]

The University of Groningen engages in many types of international cooperation throughout both teaching and research. The main networks and partners[45] of the university are:

The various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the Broerstraat. The faculty of medical sciences is located close by at the University Medical Center Groningen(UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after Nobel Prize winner Frits Zernike. The Zernike campus is also shared by the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.[49]

The university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The library at the city center also has a Starbucks on its premises. The university has also recently opened another campus in Leeuwarden, Friesland, referred to as ""Campus Fryslân"", that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.[50]

The city of Groningen is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. The university, through ACLO,[51] offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.[52]

The university also has multiple student societies that organize social events for its members, as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.

The use of bicycles as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as ""The World Cycling City"" because of this.[53]

The University of Groningen does not have student accommodation. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via SSH Student Housing, which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands.[54] A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however, a recent addition to the housing options for students is The Student Hotel as well. In an effort to combat the annual housing shortage, the city of Groningen has incentivized the construction of short-term accommodation such as The Village which is made of shipping containers for international students.[55] The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.[56]

In 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.[57] Especially in the fall semester of 2021 the housing crisis hit its peak with hundreds of students reportedly not having any accommodation and resorting to emergency shelters. [58] The housing shorting evoked a protest in the city centre which culminated in the Academy building being temporarily occupied by students to put pressure on the city to extend emergency housing. [59]

In 2019, 708 PhD students were admitted to a PhD programme (compared to 816 in 2018). Around 50% of the admitted PhD students came from abroad. In 2019, a total of 546 PhDs took place, 22 of them cum laude. The national share was thus around 11%.[60]

The University of Groningen's Graduate Schools are organized somewhat different from its international counterparts.[69] The main difference is that the Graduate Schools do not contain all Master's programmes; Graduate Schools manage and facilitate the two-year Master's programmes: top master's degree programmes and Research master's degree programmes.

Notable alumni of the University of Groningen include:[70]

Heads of Government

Utrecht University (UU; Dutch: Universiteit Utrecht, formerly Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht) is a public research university in Utrecht, Netherlands. Established 26 March 1636 (387 years ago) (1636-03-26), it is one of the oldest universities in the Netherlands. In 2022, it had an enrollment of 37,675 students, and employed 8,584 faculty members and staff.[2] More than 400 PhD degrees were awarded and 8,500 scientific articles were published. The university's 2022 budget was €2.606 billion, consisting of €1.067 billion for the university[2] and €1.539 billion for the University Medical College Utrecht.[4]

The university's interdisciplinary research targets life sciences, pathways to sustainability, dynamics of youth, and institutions for open societies. Its teaching and research are strongly connected where equality, diversity, and inclusion are valued.
Utrecht University counts a number of distinguished scholars among its alumni and faculty, including 12 Nobel Prize laureates, 19 Spinoza Prize and 2 NWO Stevin Prize laureates. Utrecht University is led by the University Board, consisting of Henk Kummeling (Rector Magnificus), Anton Pijpers (chair), Margot van der Starre (Vice Chair) and Anneloes Krul (Student Assessor).

Close ties are harboured with other institutions internationally through its membership in the Coimbra Group (CG), the League of European Research Universities (LERU), the Utrecht Network and the European University Association (EUA).

Utrecht University was founded on 26 March 1636.[5] It has its roots in the Illustrious School of Utrecht, which founded two years earlier in 1634 before being elevated to the status of university in 1636. The influential professor of theology Gisbertus Voetius delivered the inaugural speech, and Bernardus Schotanus (professor of law and mathematics) became the university's first rector magnificus. Anna Maria van Schurman, who became the university's first female student, was invited to write a Latin poem for the inauguration.[6] Initially, only a few dozen students attended classes at the university. Seven professors worked in four faculties: philosophy, which offered all students an introductory education, and three higher-level faculties (theology, medicine and law).

Utrecht University flourished in the seventeenth century, and contributed significantly to the Dutch Golden Age, despite competition with the older universities, such as Leiden (1575) and Groningen (1614). Leiden, in particular, proved a strong competitor and made further improvement necessary; a rivalry that persists to this day. A botanical garden was built on the grounds of the present Sonnenborgh Observatory, and three years later the Smeetoren added an astronomical observatory. The university attracted many students from abroad (especially from Germany, England and Scotland). They witnessed the intellectual and theological battle fought between proponents of the new philosophy (René Descartes lived for a few years in Utrecht) and proponents of the strict Reformed theologian Voetius. They also witnessed the teachings of renowned Dutch jurist, Johannes Voet, a university alumnus and professor of law, whose works remain highly authoritative in modern Roman-Dutch law.

In 1806, the French occupying authorities of the Netherlands downgraded Utrecht University to an école secondaire (high school), but after the establishment of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1813 it regained its former status.[5] Leiden, Leuven, Groningen, Utrecht and Ghent were the five universities (Dutch: hoge scholen) of the new state. Two of the universities (Leuven and Ghent) became part of the new Belgian state after their respective provinces separated from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830. As a result, Utrecht University remained one of only three Dutch universities. During the French occupation, King Louis Napoleon ordered the construction of a palace in the centre of Utrecht, which eventually became the University Library City Centre.[5]

Utrecht University played a prominent role in the golden age of Dutch science. Around 1850 the ""Utrechtian School"" of science formed, with Pieter Harting, Gerardus J. Mulder, Christophorus H. D. Buys Ballot and Franciscus Donders among the leading scientists. They introduced the educational laboratory (onderwijslaboratorium) as a practical learning place for their students. The National Veterinary School (Dutch:Rijks Veeartsenijschool) became Utrecht University's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1918.

As the university grew, the academic buildings in the historic city centre were unable to meet the university's increasing need for space. Therefore, starting from the 1960s, a significant part of the university moved to the De Uithof campus, which occupies the easternmost part of the city and is located south of De Bilt. However, the university continued to retain its academic buildings and presence in the historic city centre.

The university is represented in the Stichting Academisch Erfgoed, a foundation with the goal of preserving the university's heritage and collections.



The university consists of seven faculties, which offer 58 undergraduate degree programmes and over 150 graduate programmes.[7]

There are also three interfaculty units:

The two large faculties of Humanities and Law & Governance are situated in the inner city of Utrecht. The other five faculties and most of the administrative services are located in Utrecht Science Park De Uithof, a campus area on the outskirts of the city. University College Utrecht, along with the Utrecht School of Economics, are situated in the former Kromhout Kazerne, which used to be a Dutch military base. University College Roosevelt is located off-campus in the city of Middelburg in the south-west of the Netherlands.

On the 2023 AWRU list, the University of Utrecht was ranked 52nd globally and the highest in the Netherlands. Its ranking has declined slightly since 2003, when it was ranked 40th.

leiden.txt,leiden.txt,"Leiden University (abbreviated as LEI;[4][5] Dutch: Universiteit Leiden) is a public research university in Leiden, Netherlands. It was founded as a Protestant university in 1575[6] by William, Prince of Orange, making it the oldest institution of higher education in the Netherlands.

Known for its historic foundations and emphasis on the social sciences, the university came into particular prominence during the Dutch Golden Age, when scholars from around Europe were attracted to the Dutch Republic due to its climate of intellectual tolerance. During this time, Leiden became the home to individuals such as René Descartes, Rembrandt, Christiaan Huygens, Hugo Grotius, Baruch Spinoza, and Baron d'Holbach.

The university has seven academic faculties and over fifty subject departments, housing more than forty national and international research institutes. Its historical primary campus consists of buildings in multiple places in the college town of Leiden, while a second campus located in The Hague houses a liberal arts college (Leiden University College The Hague) and several of its faculties. It is a member of the Coimbra Group, the Europaeum, and a founding member of the League of European Research Universities.

The university has produced twenty-six Spinoza Prize Laureates and sixteen Nobel Laureates. Members of the Dutch royal family such as Queen Juliana, Queen Beatrix, and King Willem-Alexander are alumni, and ten prime ministers of the Netherlands including incumbent Mark Rutte. US President John Quincy Adams also studied at the university.[7]

In 1575, the emerging Dutch Republic did not have universities in its northern heartland. The only other university in the Habsburg Netherlands was the University of Leuven located in an area under firm Spanish control. Prince William founded Leiden University to give the Northern Netherlands an institution that could educate its citizens in religion and provide the government with educated men in all fields.[8][9] It is said the choice fell on Leiden as a reward for the heroic defence of Leiden against Spanish attacks in 1574. The name of Philip II of Spain, William's adversary, appears on the official foundation certificate as he was still the de jure count of Holland.[10] Philip II forbade all his subjects to study in Leiden.

The new institution was initially located in the Convent of Saint Barbara, then moved to the Faliede Bagijn Church in 1577 (now the location of the university museum) and in 1581 to a former convent of Cistercian nuns, a site which it still occupies, though the original building was destroyed by a fire in 1616.[8]

Leiden University's reputation was created in part by the presence of scholars such as Justus Lipsius, Joseph Scaliger, Franciscus Gomarus, Hugo Grotius, Jacobus Arminius, Daniel Heinsius, and Gerhard Johann Vossius within fifty years of its founding. By the 1640s, over five hundred students were enrolled from all across Europe, making it the largest Protestant university.[11][9] Baruch Spinoza discovered Descartes's work partly at Leiden University,[12] which he visited for periods of study multiple times.[13] In the 18th century, Jacobus Gronovius, Herman Boerhaave, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, and David Ruhnken were among the renowned academics of the university.

In 1896, the Zeeman effect was discovered at the institution by Pieter Zeeman and shortly afterward explained by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.[14] In the world's first university low-temperature laboratory, Professor Heike Kamerlingh Onnes achieved a temperature only one degree above absolute zero. In 1908, he was also the first to succeed in liquifying helium and has played a role in the discovery of superconductivity in metals.[15]

The University Library has more than 5.2 million books and fifty thousand journals. It also has collections of Western and Oriental manuscripts, printed books, archives, prints, drawings, photographs, maps, and atlases. It houses the world's largest collections on Indonesia and the Caribbean, collected by the Scaliger Institute which studies various aspects of knowledge transmissions and ideas through texts and images from antiquity to the present day. In 2005, the manuscript of Einstein on the quantum theory of the monatomic ideal gas (the Einstein-Bose condensation) was discovered in one of Leiden's libraries.[16]

In 2012 Leiden entered into a strategic alliance with Delft University of Technology and Erasmus University Rotterdam for the universities to increase the quality of their research and teaching. The university is also the unofficial home of the Bilderberg Group, a meeting of high-level political and economic figures from North America and Europe. Leiden University partnered with Duke University School of Law starting in 2017 to run a joint summer program on global and transnational law from its Hague campus.

The university has no central campus; its buildings are spread over the city. Some buildings, like the Gravensteen, are very old, while Van Steenis, Lipsius and Gorlaeus are much more modern.[17]

Among the institutions affiliated with the university are The KITLV or Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (founded in 1851), the Leiden Observatory 1633; the Natural History Museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities), with especially valuable Egyptian and Indian departments; a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was Philipp Franz von Siebold's Japanese collections. The anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.[citation needed]

The Hortus Botanicus (botanical garden) is the oldest botanical garden in the Netherlands and one of the oldest in the world. Plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries. The Clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th-century Orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the Japanese Siebold Memorial Museum symbolising the historical link between East and West, the tropical greenhouses with their world-class plant collections, and the central square and Conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from South Africa and southern Europe.[citation needed]

In 1998, the university has expanded to The Hague which has become home to Campus The Hague, with six of the seven faculties represented and exclusive home to the Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs, International Studies and Leiden University College The Hague, a liberal arts and sciences college. Here, the university offers academic courses in the fields of law, political science, public administration and medicine. It occupied a number of buildings in the centre of the city, including a college building at Lange Voorhout, before moving into the new 'Wijnhaven' building on Turfmarkt in 2016.

The Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs was established in 2011, together with the University College, and one of the largest programmes of the Faculty of Humanities, International Studies.

Since 2017 Leiden University Medical Center also has a branch at Campus The Hague.

The university is divided into seven major faculties which offer approximately 50 undergraduate degree programmes and over 100 graduate programmes.

Most of the university's departments offer their degree programme(s). Undergraduate programmes lead to either a B.A., B.Sc., or LL.B. degree. Other degrees, such as the B.Eng. or B.F.A., are not awarded at Leiden University.

Students can choose from a range of graduate programmes. Most of the above-mentioned undergraduate programmes can be continued with either a general or a specialised graduate program. Leiden University offers more than 100 graduate programs leading to either MA, MSc, MPhil, or LLM degrees. The MPhil is the most advanced graduate degree and is awarded by select university departments (mostly in the fields of Arts, Social Sciences, Archeology, Philosophy, and Theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career or before going into law or medicine. Traditionally, the MPhil degree enabled its holder to teach at the university levels as an associate professor.

In addition, most departments, affiliated (research) institutes, or faculties offer doctorate programmes or positions, leading to the Ph.D. degree. Most of the Ph.D. programmes offered by the university are concentrated in several research schools or institutes.

Leiden University has more than 50 research and graduate schools and institutes. Some of them are fully affiliated with one faculty of the university, while others are interfaculty institutes or interuniversity institutes.

Of the 107 Spinoza Prize laureates (the highest scientific award of The Netherlands), twenty-six were granted to professors of Leiden University. Literary historian Frits van Oostrom was the first professor of Leiden to be granted the Spinoza award for his work on developing the NLCM centre (Dutch literature and culture in the Middle Ages) into a top research centre. Other Spinoza Prize winners are linguists Frederik Kortlandt and Pieter Muysken, mathematician Hendrik Lenstra, physicists Carlo Beenakker, Jan Zaanen, Dirk Bouwmeester and Michel Orrit, astronomers Ewine van Dishoeck, Marijn Franx and Alexander Tielens, transplantation biologist Els Goulmy, clinical epidemiologist Frits Rosendaal, pedagogue Marinus van IJzendoorn, archeologists Wil Roebroeks and Corinne Hofman, neurologist Michel Ferrari, classicist Ineke Sluiter, social psychologist Naomi Ellemers, statistician Aad van der Vaart, cognitive psychologist Eveline Crone, organisation psychologist Carsten de Dreu, chemical immunologist Sjaak Neefjes, parasitologist Maria Yazdanbakhsh, electrochemist Mark Koper and astrophysicist Ignas Snellen.

The Stevin Prize laureates who have achieved exceptional success in knowledge exchange and impact for society include the following Leiden professors: health psychologist Andrea Evers, immunology technologist Ton Schumacher and psychologist Judi Mesman.[39] Among other leading professors are Wim Blockmans, professor of Medieval History, and Willem Adelaar, professor of Amerindian Languages.

Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1913. Three other professors received the Nobel Prize for their research performed at Universiteit Leiden: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman received the Nobel Prize for their pioneering work in the field of optical and electronic phenomena, and the physiologist Willem Einthoven for his invention of the string galvanometer, which among other things, enabled the development of electrocardiography.

Nobel laureates associated with Leiden include the physicists Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and Paul Ehrenfest. Also: Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Johannes Diderik van der Waals, Tobias Asser, Albert Szent-Györgyi, Igor Tamm, Jan Tinbergen, Nikolaas Tinbergen, Tjalling Koopmans, Nicolaas Bloembergen, and Niels Jerne.[40]

Other notable Leiden researchers were the Arabist and Islam expert Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, the law expert Cornelis van Vollenhoven and historian Johan Huizinga, all during the 1920s and 1930s. Martinus Beijerinck, one of the founders of virology, finished his Ph.D. at Leiden in 1877.","leiden university (abbreviated as lei;[4][5] dutch: universiteit leiden) is a public research university in leiden, netherlands. it was founded as a protestant university in 1575[6] by william, prince of orange, making it the oldest institution of higher education in the netherlands.

among the institutions affiliated with the university are the kitlv or royal netherlands institute of southeast asian and caribbean studies (founded in 1851), the leiden observatory 1633; the natural history museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the rijksmuseum van oudheden (national museum of antiquities), with especially valuable egyptian and indian departments; a museum of dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was philipp franz von siebold's japanese collections. the anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.[citation needed]

the hortus botanicus (botanical garden) is the oldest botanical garden in the netherlands and one of the oldest in the world. plants from all over the world have been carefully cultivated here by experts for more than four centuries. the clusius garden (a reconstruction), the 18th-century orangery with its monumental tub plants, the rare collection of historical trees hundreds of years old, the japanese siebold memorial museum symbolising the historical link between east and west, the tropical greenhouses with their world-class plant collections, and the central square and conservatory exhibiting exotic plants from south africa and southern europe.[citation needed]

in 1998, the university has expanded to the hague which has become home to campus the hague, with six of the seven faculties represented and exclusive home to the faculty of governance and global affairs, international studies and leiden university college the hague, a liberal arts and sciences college. here, the university offers academic courses in the fields of law, political science, public administration and medicine. it occupied a number of buildings in the centre of the city, including a college building at lange voorhout, before moving into the new 'wijnhaven' building on turfmarkt in 2016.

the faculty of governance and global affairs was established in 2011, together with the university college, and one of the largest programmes of the faculty of humanities, international studies.

since 2017 leiden university medical center also has a branch at campus the hague.

the university is divided into seven major faculties which offer approximately 50 undergraduate degree programmes and over 100 graduate programmes.

most of the university's departments offer their degree programme(s). undergraduate programmes lead to either a b.a., b.sc., or ll.b. degree. other degrees, such as the b.eng. or b.f.a., are not awarded at leiden university.

students can choose from a range of graduate programmes. most of the above-mentioned undergraduate programmes can be continued with either a general or a specialised graduate program. leiden university offers more than 100 graduate programs leading to either ma, msc, mphil, or llm degrees. the mphil is the most advanced graduate degree and is awarded by select university departments (mostly in the fields of arts, social sciences, archeology, philosophy, and theology). admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career or before going into law or medicine. traditionally, the mphil degree enabled its holder to teach at the university levels as an associate professor.

in addition, most departments, affiliated (research) institutes, or faculties offer doctorate programmes or positions, leading to the ph.d. degree. most of the ph.d. programmes offered by the university are concentrated in several research schools or institutes.

leiden university has more than 50 research and graduate schools and institutes. some of them are fully affiliated with one faculty of the university, while others are interfaculty institutes or interuniversity institutes.

hanze.txt,hanze.txt,"Hanze University of Applied Sciences (abbreviated as: Hanze UAS; Dutch: Hanzehogeschool Groningen) is the largest vocational university in the northern Netherlands[1] and located in Groningen.

Hanze UAS offers various Bachelor and Master programmes in Dutch, English, and German, and works closely with international partner institutes. The school counts approximately 28,000 students and 3,200 employees. About, 8,1% of students are international.[2][3]

Hanze UAS was founded in 1986 as the merger of various local institutes for professional education, the oldest of which is the Academie Minerva, founded in 1798, which was the first multi-sectoral institute for practical higher education in the Netherlands. The mission of the Academy Minerva was “The improvement of Drawing, Construction and Nautical Sciences, together with the aligned Arts and Sciences, within all ranks of society, and in particular to improve the skills of the disadvantaged.""[4] Throughout the centuries that followed many more institutions, engaged in a wide range of different fields, were established.

In 1986, Groningen was the first city in the Netherlands where 16 of the 24 vocational schools merged into a larger institute, as recommended in the government paper “Expansion, Division of Tasks, and Concentration in the Higher Educational System”.[4] Hence, Hanze became quickly one of the biggest Universities of Applied Sciences in the nation and data suggests it is growing every year.[5] In 1989 the university joined the Erasmus Programme and in 2014 Hanze became holder of the Erasmus Charter of Higher Education 2014–2020.[6][7]

The name of Hanze UAS is linked to the Hanseatic League (Dutch: Hanze). Groningen, the city hosting the majority of the university's facilities, was member of the Hanseatic League between 1282 and 1669.[8]

(from March 20, 2019)[3]

Hanze University has the majority of its major facilities in Groningen, with few minor ones in Amsterdam (Dance Academy), Assen (Hanze Institute of Technology) and Leeuwarden (Pop Culture).

The remaining 16 schools are located in the city of Groningen. With the exception of the oldest facility, the Academy Minerva, that is in the city center, all major facilities are in the Zernike Campus (Named after Frits Zernike). This large area north of the city (in the Noordwest district) is home to both Hanze institutions and facilities of the University of Groningen, the research university of the city. The campus overall hosts about 60,000 students.[9][10][11]

delft.txt,delft.txt,"The Delft University of Technology (TU Delft; Dutch: Technische Universiteit Delft) is the oldest and largest Dutch public technical university, located in Delft, Netherlands. As of 2022[update] it is ranked by QS World University Rankings among the top 10 engineering and technology universities in the world.[6] In 2023 it was ranked 2nd in the world in civil engineering, 3rd in the world in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and 3rd in the world in architecture.[7]

With eight faculties and numerous research institutes,[8] it has more than 27,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate) and 6,600 employees (teaching, research, support and management staff).[9]

The university was established on 8 January 1842 by King William II as a royal academy, with the primary purpose of training civil servants for work in the Dutch East Indies. The school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. It changed its name to Delft University of Technology in 1986.[1]

Dutch Nobel laureates Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, and Simon van der Meer have been associated with TU Delft. TU Delft is a member of several university federations, including the IDEA League, CESAER, UNITECH International, ENHANCE Alliance, LDE, and 4TU.

Delft University of Technology was founded on 8 January 1842 by William II of the Netherlands as Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade.[1] One of the purposes of the academy was to educate civil servants for the colonies of the Dutch East India Company. The first director of the academy was Antoine Lipkens, constructor of the first Dutch optical telegraph, called simply as Lipkens. Royal Academy had its first building located at Oude Delft 95 in Delft. On 23 May 1863 an Act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the Netherlands, bringing it under the rules of secondary education.

On 20 June 1864, Royal Academy in Delft was disbanded by a Royal Decree, giving a way to a Polytechnic School of Delft (Politechnische School te Delft). The newly formed school educated engineers of various fields and architects, so much needed during the rapid industrialization period in the 19th century.

Yet another Act, passed on 22 May 1905, changed the name of the school to Technical College (Institute) of Delft (Technische Hoogeschool Delft, from 1934 Technische Hogeschool Delft), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. Polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. The number of students reached 450 around that time. The official opening of the new school was attended by Queen Wilhelmina on 10 July 1905. First dean of the newly established college was ir. J. Kraus, hydraulic engineer. In 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded.[10] From 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966 the ceremonies were held in the Saint Hippolytus Chapel.[11]

Corporate rights were granted to the college on 7 June 1956. Most of the university buildings during that time were located within Delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river Schie, in the Wippolder district.

Student organizations grew together with the university. The first to be established on 22 March 1848 is the Delftsch Studenten Corps housed in the distinctive Sociëteit Phoenix on the Phoenixstraat.  This was followed by the Delftsche Studenten Bond  (est. 30 October 1897) and the KSV Sanctus Virgilius (est. 2 March 1898). In 1917 Proof Garden for Technical Plantation (Dutch: Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen) was established by Gerrit van Iterson, which today is known as Botanical Garden of TU Delft. In that period a first female professor, Toos Korvezee, was appointed.

After the end of World War II, TU Delft increased its rapid academic expansion. Studium Generale was established at all universities in the Netherlands, including TU Delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. Because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first Reception Week for First Year Students (Ontvangst Week voor Eerstejaars Studenten, OWEE) was established, which became a TU Delft tradition since then.

On 1 September 1986, the Delft Institute of Technology officially changed its name to Delft University of Technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. In the course of further expansion, in 1987 Delft Top Tech[12] institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. On 1 September 1997, the 13 faculties of the TU Delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. In the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate emancipation commission. As a result, Girls Study Technology (Meiden studeren techniek) days were established. In later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.

Since 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of Delft. The relatively new building of Material Sciences department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the Haagse Hogeschool. Closer cooperation between TU Delft and Dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to Delft. In September 2009 many institutes of applied sciences from the Hague region as well as Institute of Applied Sciences in Rijswijk, transferred to Delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between Rotterdamseweg and Leeghwaterstraat.

In 2007 the three Dutch technical universities, TU Delft, TU Eindhoven and University of Twente, established a federation, called 3TU.

On 13 May 2008, the building of the Faculty of Architecture was destroyed by fire, presumed caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. Luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by Gerrit Rietveld and Le Corbusier, were saved. The Faculty of Architecture is currently housed in the university's former main building.

Through the course of the years the logo of the TU Delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. The current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white.[5] The letter ""T"" bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that Prometheus brought from Mount Olympus to the people, against the will of Zeus. Because of this, Prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. His statue stood in the center of the newly renovated TU Delft campus, Mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.[13]

Initially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of Delft. This changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. The last university building in the historic centre of Delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. On the 12 September 2006 the design of the new university neighbourhood, Mekelpark, was officially approved,[14] giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the Mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. The new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.

New university neighborhood called Mekelpark (its name commemorating TH Delft professor and WW II resistance fighter, Jan Mekel, who was executed by the Nazis on 2 May 1942 in Sachsenhausen) was opened on 5 July 2009. Mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and filling stations, constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. Its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. Both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total.[14] Some of the university buildings around the Mekelpark deserve certain attention.

TU Delft Aula was designed by Van den Broek en Bakema architecture bureau founded by two TU Delft alumni Jo van den Broek and Jaap Bakema. It was officially opened on 6 January 1966 by Dutch Prime Minister Jo Cals. It is a classical example of a structure built in Brutalist style. TU Delft Aula, which symbolically opens the Mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as lecture halls, auditoria, congress center, and administrative offices of the university. All doctoral promotion, honoris causa ceremonies, as well as academic senate meetings take place in the Aula.

The TU Delft Library, constructed in 1997, was designed by Delft-based Mecanoo architecture bureau. It is located behind university aula. The roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. The structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. The library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. All the walls are completely filled with glass. The library won the Dutch National Steel Prize in 1998 in the buildings of steel and hybrid constructions category. The library is also host of the 4TU.Centre for Research Data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the Netherlands.

The TU Delft Sports and Culture Center, recently renamed X, is located at Mekelweg 10, at the edge of the Mekelpark. It was designed by architect Vera Yanovshtchinsky and opened to TU Delft students and staff in 1995. Since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.

Three musea are associated with the university: Science Centre Delft,[15] Mineralogy-geology museum and Beijerinck en Kluyver archive.

Science Centre Delft was opened in September 2010 and is located at Mijnbouwstraat 120 in Delft. Science Center Delft is a successor of Technical Exhibition Center.[16] Technical Exhibition Center was established by a group of TU Delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. Parts of the collection were shown outside of Delft: in the Netherlands and abroad, including Israel and Czech Republic. The collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of geodesy. The historical collections of Technical Exhibition Center were moved Delft Museum of Technology, located at Ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of naval architecture (Werktuig- en Scheepsbouwkunde), next to the city center of Delft. As Delft city council together with TU Delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into lofts), Science Centre Delft shows visitors current TU Delft research projects are available, including Eco Runner and Nuna.

Beijerinck en Kluyver archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.

Mineralogy-geology museum is a part of TU Delft Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences and contains around 200,000 geological, mineralogical and crystallographical items divided into numerous sub-collections. The oldest items date back to 1842 when the TU Delft (then Delft Royal Academy) was established.

TU Delft botanical garden dates back to 1917, where Proof Garden for Technical Plantation (Dutch: Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen) was established by Gerrit van Iterson Jr., TU Delft graduate and assistant to Martinus Beijerinck.[17] Gerrit van Iterson Jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. Creation of botanical gardens at TU Delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of tropical agriculture in then Dutch colony of Dutch East Indies.[17] Over 7000 different species of plants, including tropical and subtropical plants, herbs, and ornamental plants cover the area of almost 2.5 ha.[17] Furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university's greenhouses. All facilities of TU Delft botanical garden are open to the public.

Along with Delft, UNStudio developed the 'Echo' building on the TU campus for interfaculty lecture halls, study areas, and Cybersecurity research offices. It is an energy-producing building within the campus of Delft which aims at energy conservation to delve into the future.[18]

In September 2016, TU Delft inaugurated a new campus in The Hague.[19] The MSc programme Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA), which teaches students to operate at the intersection of technology and policy when tackling wicked problems, was relocated to this new site to capitalize on its proximity to government ministries, international bodies, and multinational organizations.[19][20]

TU Delft operates the 5th floor of the Wijnhaven Building at Turfmarkt 99 in The Hague, with the rest of the building being occupied by Leiden University.[21] Originally the Ministry of the Interior's headquarters at Schedeldoekshaven 200, the Wijnhaven Building, named after the historic Wijnhavenkwartier, was converted into Campus The Hague in 2016.[22]

In 2023, TU Delft announced plans to further expand its footprint in The Hague by launching a joint university facility with Leiden University at Spui,  set to open in 2025.[23] This new location is expected to accommodate around 600 TU Delft students in the city centre of The Hague.[23]

TU Delft comprises eight faculties.[24] These are (official Dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets):

Since 2004, the TU Delft education system is divided into three tiers: the Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, and Doctorate. The academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from September until January and the second semester from the end of January until July. Most of the lectures are available through OpenCourseWare.

As of 2016[update] TU Delft offers 16 BSc programmes.[25] TU Delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. The test project finalizes the BSc studies. All BSc programmes are taught in Dutch, except for Aerospace Engineering, Applied Earth Sciences, Nanobiology, and Computer Science, which are taught entirely in English, and Electrical Engineering which is taught in a mixture of both.

TU Delft offers around 40 MSc programmes.[26] The MSc studies take two years to complete.

TU Delft uses the European Credit Transfer System, where each year MSc students are required to obtain 60 ECTS points. An honours track exists for motivated MSc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in Dutch grading scale) and did not fail any courses. This track, associated with 30 ECTS points, is taken alongside the regular MSc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of technology in society. The honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the MSc programme.

MSc programmes are also offered through the 3TU federation, Erasmus Mundus programmes, IDEA League joint MSc programs and QuTech Academy.

Doctoral studies at TU Delft are divided into two phases. The first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. The candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. The research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a doctoral thesis. The thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of TU Delft professors and external opponents. Once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.

In contrast to US graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving TAs form only a small portion of the programme.

The doctoral defense is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. It lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. Sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two paranymphs, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. The defense is ended by the pedel, who enters the room and says in Latin Hora est (It is time), stamping the university staff on the floor. The committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. Then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the laudation praising the new doctor. The entire ceremony is chaired by the rector or a representative.

TU Delft also offers Professional Doctorate in Engineering.

TU Delft has three officially recognized research institutes: Research Institute for the Built Environment,[27] International Research Centre for Telecommunications-transmission and Radar,[28] and Reactor Institute Delft.[29] In addition to those three institutes, TU Delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the Delft Institute of Microelectronics and Submicron Technology,[30] Kavli Institute of Nanoscience,[31] Materials innovation institute,[32] Astrodynamics and Space Missions,[33] Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute,[34]
TU Delft Safety and Security Institute,[35] and the Delft Space Institute,[36] Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. A complete list of research schools is available on TU Delft website.[8]

Important part of Dutch university system are research schools. They combine education, training and research for PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers in a given field. The main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. Research schools of TU Delft cooperate with other universities in the Netherlands. Research schools are required to have an accreditation of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. TU Delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. The full list of research schools affiliated with TU Delft is available on TU Delft website,[8] see for example TRAIL Research School.

During an academic year the TU Delft publishes a weekly magazine: Delta,[37] which aims at the student and employee community of the university. The newspaper is predominantly in Dutch, with the last few pages published in English. TU Delta is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the Internet. Articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. The weekly agenda including PhD promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.

Also, approximately four times a year, the TU Delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called Delft Outlook.[38] Delft Outlook is published in English, while the same content is published in Dutch in Delft Integraal magazine. Both magazines present interviews with TU Delft researchers, university officials. Columns by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published PhD theses.

TU Delft is governed by the executive board (College van Bestuur),[3] controlled and advised by student council, workers council, board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, deans of each TU Delft faculty, and directors of TU Delft research centers, research schools and research institutes.[39]

Executive board is chaired academically by the Rector Magnificus. The currently appointed Rector Magnificus, Tim van der Hagen, has held the position since 2018.[40] He replaced Prof. Ir. Karel Ch.A.M. Luyben[3] who was rector for the period 2010 to 2018. Previous Rectors of TU Delft include Prof. K.F. Wakker (1993–1997 and 1998–2002), Prof. J. Blauwendraad (1997–1998) and Prof. J.T. Fokkema (2002–2010). Executive board is accountable to the Supervisory Board, appointed by the Minister of Education, Culture and Science. One of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.

Board of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, research fellows as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. Board of doctorates appoints supervisors for PhD students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers PhD and doctorate Honoris Causa degrees. Committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. Further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. Operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the s. The committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.

Student life at TU Delft is organized around numerous student societies and corporations. They can be generally categorized into professional societies, social societies and sport societies. More than half of TU Delft students belong to an officially recognized society[1].

There are two student parties at TU Delft: ORAS[41] (Organisatie Rationele Studenten) and Lijst Bèta (successor of AAG).[42]  AAG (Afdeling Actie Groepen) started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then Polytechnic Institute Delft. ORAS became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to AAG. After already taking a break from the yearly elections in 2008, AAG did not participate anymore in the elections of 2010 due to disappointing results.[43] In 2011, a new party was established, Lijst Bèta, that got 2 out of the 10 seats in the student counsil.[44] Since then, Lijst Bèta and ORAS compete each year for seats in TU Delft's Students Council (Studenten Raad). Further, all student organizations of TU Delft are associated with The Council of Student Societies Delft VeRa (De VerenigingsRaad) and The Society for Study and Student Matters Delft VSSD (Vereniging voor Studie- en Studentenbelangen Delft).

Apart from bachelor and master student organizations, PhD students of TU Delft have their own organization called Promood (PhD Students Discussion Group Delft) (Promovendi Overleg Delft), which represents TU Delft PhD students at the university. It is also a member of Dutch PhD Students Network (Promovendi Netwerk Nederland).

Each faculty of TU Delft has its own set of professional student organizations. Numerous societies are present at the university,[45] many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. For example, aerospace engineering department hosts Foundation for Students in Airplane Development, Manufacturing and Management (Stichting Studenten Vliegtuigontwikkeling, -bouw en -beheer), while civil engineering department Society for Practical Studies. International professional student organizations are also present at TU Delft, including European Association of Aerospace Students.

Apart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. Many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a Catholic Wolbodo Student Society, Katholieke Studentenvereniging Sanctus Virgilius Delft, that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination.  Besides societies which have their roots in religion, there are also general (with no religious bonds) societies. One of these is Sint Jansbrug. These societies accept anyone who studies at the TU Delft or any other higher education facility in the Delft area. Also organization that has its roots in Rover Scout movement Delftsche Zwervers (at the same time the oldest student scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the European AEGEE.

Student sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. Those include rowing society D.S.R.V. Laga and rowing club Proteus-Eretes (both with many Olympic medals won by the members of the club) or American football club Delft Dragons.

TU Delft researchers developed many new technologies used today, including Glare, a Fibre Metal Laminate used in Airbus A380 skin and Vision in Product Design design method. Cees Dekker's lab at TU Delft demonstrated in 1998 the first transistor made out of single nanotube molecule. Delta Works plan was, in part, a child of TU Delft graduates, including Johan Ringers and Victor de Blocq van Kuffeler. TU Delft was a precursor of Open design concept.

In architecture, TU Delft is famous for Traditionalist School in Dutch architecture. TU Delft was a home to many prominent microbiologists including Martinus Beijerinck, who in 1898 discovered viruses while working at TU Delft, and Albert Kluyver, father of comparative microbiology, which resulted in the creation of so-called Delft School of Microbiology.

Some recent projects being developed at the university include:

The majority of TU Delft's students are male. In 2021 among all students of the university (MSc and BSc level) 30% were women. The biggest imbalance between men and women is seen in the Mechanical engineering faculty, while the smallest is seen at Industrial Design and Architecture departments.[51] Despite many efforts of the university to change that imbalance, the number of women studying at TU Delft has stayed relatively constant over the years.[51]

Since 2002 the number of students admitted to TU Delft has increased rapidly (from approximately 2,200 in 2002 to almost 3,700 in 2009).[53] The same applies to the total student population (from approximately 13,250 in 2002 to almost 16,500 in 2009).[53] In 2022, nearly 27 thousand students were enrolled.[52]

The number of international students has also increased steadily.[53] In 2021, 29% of all students at TU Delft came from abroad; nearly three quarters of those came from Europe.[54] The largest proportion of international students at TU Delft in 2022 come from China (14%), followed by India (11.4%) and Belgium (7.4%). The faculties with the highest percentage number of international students study at Aerospace Engineering (46%) and Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (38%).[55]

Due to TU Delft's presence, the city of Delft has one of the biggest populations of Iranians in the Netherlands. It resulted in one of the biggest Iranian protests against the Iranian government in Europe,[56] with many protests organized at TU Delft campus by Iranian TU Delft students during 2009 Iranian Election Protests.

As of 2015,[update] TU Delft is a home to 437 faculty, with more than 3,375 academic staff.[57] The responsibility of TU Delft professors is lecturing, guiding undergraduate and graduate students, as well as performing original research in their respective fields.

Many notable people were TU Delft faculty. In science, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, a 1913 Nobel Laureate in physics, a discoverer of superconductivity, was a former TU Delft faculty member, working as an assistant to Johannes Bosscha. Discoverer of the Prins reaction Hendrik Jacobus Prins, co-founders of National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science Hendrik Anthony Kramers and David van Dantzig, developer of the iodide process Jan Hendrik de Boer, discoverer of the particle spin Ralph Kronig, discoverer of the Einstein–de Haas effect Wander Johannes de Haas and discoverer of hafnium Dirk Coster, all were at some point the faculty members of the university. Faculty members of Delft School of Microbiology were the founder of modern microbiology Martinus Beijerinck and the father of comparative microbiology Albert Kluyver.

In engineering, the inventor of penthode and gyrator Bernard Tellegen and Balthasar van der Pol developer of Van der Pol oscillator, were TU Delft faculty. Currently Vic Hayes, and the father of Wi-Fi, is affiliated with the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. STS-61A of the Space Shuttle Challenger crew member Wubbo Ockels was professor of Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology. TU Delft faculty geologist were Berend George Escher, Johannes Herman Frederik Umbgrove, discoverer of Bushveld complex Gustaaf Adolf Frederik Molengraaff and discoverer of gravity anomalies above the sea level Felix Andries Vening Meinesz.

Since TU Delft is a home to a major architecture school in the Netherlands, many important architects were a faculty of the university, including Hein de Haan, founder of Traditionalist School in Architecture Marinus Jan Granpré Molière, Bent Flyvbjerg, co-founder of Mecanoo architects bureau Francine Houben, co-founder of MVRDV architects bureau Winy Maas and Nathalie de Vries, co-founder of Team 10 Jacob B.

Other interesting figures that studied at TU Delft were mathematician Diederik Korteweg, responsible for Korteweg–de Vries equation, who studied at TU Delft before moving to University of Amsterdam and painter Maurits Cornelis Escher who studied at TU Delft for a year. Thomas Jan Stieltjes, co-developer of Riemann–Stieltjes integral studied at TU Delft but never passed his final exams. The internationally renowned graphic designer and industrial designer Piet Zwart studied at the university 1913–1914.

TU Delft alumni who are currently a faculty of other universities include Wilhelmus Luxemburg, Dutch mathematician and California Institute of Technology professor, as well as Walter Lewin, Dutch physicist and former MIT professor, and Alexander van Oudenaarden, Dutch biophysicist, a director of the Hubrecht Institute.

In 1906 TU Delft obtained the right to award PhD degrees. This also marked the date since when the university was able to award honorary doctorates. Between 1906 and 2006 exactly 100 honoris causa degrees have been awarded. Honorary doctoral degrees are awarded to people that presented extraordinary contributions in their respective fields. Some of the most recognized recipients of TU Delft honorary doctorate include:

TU Delft was 47th worldwide in QS WUR 2024, 48th worldwide in THE WUR 2024, 169th worldwide in USNEWS 2022-2023, and 151-200th worldwide in ARWU 2022. It was the 78th best-ranked university worldwide in 2022 in terms of aggregate performance across THE, QS, and ARWU, as reported by ARTU.[71]

TU Delft was 43rd worldwide in the THE World Reputation Rankings 2022.

It was also the 15th most international university worldwide in 2023 according to THE.

TU Delft is ranked a top university for engineering and technology worldwide, being positioned for this subject at 10th place in 2022 by QS World University Rankings,[6] at 21st place in 2022 by Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[72] and respectively at 21st and 7th place for engineering and civil engineering accordingly in 2020 by U.S. News & World Report Best Global University Ranking.[73][74]

In the field of Civil & Structural Engineering, TU Delft has been ranked among the world's top 2 in 2022, in the field of Architecture among the world's top 2 since 2012, and in the field of Mechanical Engineering in the top 5 since 2022 by QS World University Rankings.[75]

TU Delft has formed partnerships with leading universities across Europe for student exchange and combined degree programs.

TU Delft has partnered with many universities worldwide for exchanges.[77]","the delft university of technology (tu delft; dutch: technische universiteit delft) is the oldest and largest dutch public technical university, located in delft, netherlands. as of 2022[update] it is ranked by qs world university rankings among the top 10 engineering and technology universities in the world.[6] in 2023 it was ranked 2nd in the world in civil engineering, 3rd in the world in mechanical and aerospace engineering, and 3rd in the world in architecture.[7]

with eight faculties and numerous research institutes,[8] it has more than 27,000 students (undergraduate and postgraduate) and 6,600 employees (teaching, research, support and management staff).[9]

the university was established on 8 january 1842 by king william ii as a royal academy, with the primary purpose of training civil servants for work in the dutch east indies. the school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. it changed its name to delft university of technology in 1986.[1]

dutch nobel laureates jacobus henricus van 't hoff, heike kamerlingh onnes, and simon van der meer have been associated with tu delft. tu delft is a member of several university federations, including the idea league, cesaer, unitech international, enhance alliance, lde, and 4tu.

delft university of technology was founded on 8 january 1842 by william ii of the netherlands as royal academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade.[1] one of the purposes of the academy was to educate civil servants for the colonies of the dutch east india company. the first director of the academy was antoine lipkens, constructor of the first dutch optical telegraph, called simply as lipkens. royal academy had its first building located at oude delft 95 in delft. on 23 may 1863 an act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the netherlands, bringing it under the rules of secondary education.

on 20 june 1864, royal academy in delft was disbanded by a royal decree, giving a way to a polytechnic school of delft (politechnische school te delft). the newly formed school educated engineers of various fields and architects, so much needed during the rapid industrialization period in the 19th century.

yet another act, passed on 22 may 1905, changed the name of the school to technical college (institute) of delft (technische hoogeschool delft, from 1934 technische hogeschool delft), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. the number of students reached 450 around that time. the official opening of the new school was attended by queen wilhelmina on 10 july 1905. first dean of the newly established college was ir. j. kraus, hydraulic engineer. in 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded.[10] from 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966 the ceremonies were held in the saint hippolytus chapel.[11]

corporate rights were granted to the college on 7 june 1956. most of the university buildings during that time were located within delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river schie, in the wippolder district.

student organizations grew together with the university. the first to be established on 22 march 1848 is the delftsch studenten corps housed in the distinctive sociëteit phoenix on the phoenixstraat.  this was followed by the delftsche studenten bond  (est. 30 october 1897) and the ksv sanctus virgilius (est. 2 march 1898). in 1917 proof garden for technical plantation (dutch: cultuurtuin voor technische gewassen) was established by gerrit van iterson, which today is known as botanical garden of tu delft. in that period a first female professor, toos korvezee, was appointed.

after the end of world war ii, tu delft increased its rapid academic expansion. studium generale was established at all universities in the netherlands, including tu delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first reception week for first year students (ontvangst week voor eerstejaars studenten, owee) was established, which became a tu delft tradition since then.

on 1 september 1986, the delft institute of technology officially changed its name to delft university of technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. in the course of further expansion, in 1987 delft top tech[12] institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. on 1 september 1997, the 13 faculties of the tu delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. in the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate emancipation commission. as a result, girls study technology (meiden studeren techniek) days were established. in later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.

since 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of delft. the relatively new building of material sciences department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the haagse hogeschool. closer cooperation between tu delft and dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to delft. in september 2009 many institutes of applied sciences from the hague region as well as institute of applied sciences in rijswijk, transferred to delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between rotterdamseweg and leeghwaterstraat.

in 2007 the three dutch technical universities, tu delft, tu eindhoven and university of twente, established a federation, called 3tu.

on 13 may 2008, the building of the faculty of architecture was destroyed by fire, presumed caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by gerrit rietveld and le corbusier, were saved. the faculty of architecture is currently housed in the university's former main building.

through the course of the years the logo of the tu delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. the current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white.[5] the letter ""t"" bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that prometheus brought from mount olympus to the people, against the will of zeus. because of this, prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. his statue stood in the center of the newly renovated tu delft campus, mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.[13]

initially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of delft. this changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. the last university building in the historic centre of delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. on the 12 september 2006 the design of the new university neighbourhood, mekelpark, was officially approved,[14] giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. the new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.

new university neighborhood called mekelpark (its name commemorating th delft professor and ww ii resistance fighter, jan mekel, who was executed by the nazis on 2 may 1942 in sachsenhausen) was opened on 5 july 2009. mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and filling stations, constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total.[14] some of the university buildings around the mekelpark deserve certain attention.

tu delft aula was designed by van den broek en bakema architecture bureau founded by two tu delft alumni jo van den broek and jaap bakema. it was officially opened on 6 january 1966 by dutch prime minister jo cals. it is a classical example of a structure built in brutalist style. tu delft aula, which symbolically opens the mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as lecture halls, auditoria, congress center, and administrative offices of the university. all doctoral promotion, honoris causa ceremonies, as well as academic senate meetings take place in the aula.

the tu delft library, constructed in 1997, was designed by delft-based mecanoo architecture bureau. it is located behind university aula. the roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. the structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. the library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. all the walls are completely filled with glass. the library won the dutch national steel prize in 1998 in the buildings of steel and hybrid constructions category. the library is also host of the 4tu.centre for research data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the netherlands.

the tu delft sports and culture center, recently renamed x, is located at mekelweg 10, at the edge of the mekelpark. it was designed by architect vera yanovshtchinsky and opened to tu delft students and staff in 1995. since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.

three musea are associated with the university: science centre delft,[15] mineralogy-geology museum and beijerinck en kluyver archive.

science centre delft was opened in september 2010 and is located at mijnbouwstraat 120 in delft. science center delft is a successor of technical exhibition center.[16] technical exhibition center was established by a group of tu delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. parts of the collection were shown outside of delft: in the netherlands and abroad, including israel and czech republic. the collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of geodesy. the historical collections of technical exhibition center were moved delft museum of technology, located at ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of naval architecture (werktuig- en scheepsbouwkunde), next to the city center of delft. as delft city council together with tu delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into lofts), science centre delft shows visitors current tu delft research projects are available, including eco runner and nuna.

beijerinck en kluyver archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.

mineralogy-geology museum is a part of tu delft faculty of civil engineering and geosciences and contains around 200,000 geological, mineralogical and crystallographical items divided into numerous sub-collections. the oldest items date back to 1842 when the tu delft (then delft royal academy) was established.

tu delft botanical garden dates back to 1917, where proof garden for technical plantation (dutch: cultuurtuin voor technische gewassen) was established by gerrit van iterson jr., tu delft graduate and assistant to martinus beijerinck.[17] gerrit van iterson jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. creation of botanical gardens at tu delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of tropical agriculture in then dutch colony of dutch east indies.[17] over 7000 different species of plants, including tropical and subtropical plants, herbs, and ornamental plants cover the area of almost 2.5 ha.[17] furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university's greenhouses. all facilities of tu delft botanical garden are open to the public.

along with delft, unstudio developed the 'echo' building on the tu campus for interfaculty lecture halls, study areas, and cybersecurity research offices. it is an energy-producing building within the campus of delft which aims at energy conservation to delve into the future.[18]

in september 2016, tu delft inaugurated a new campus in the hague.[19] the msc programme engineering and policy analysis (epa), which teaches students to operate at the intersection of technology and policy when tackling wicked problems, was relocated to this new site to capitalize on its proximity to government ministries, international bodies, and multinational organizations.[19][20]

tu delft operates the 5th floor of the wijnhaven building at turfmarkt 99 in the hague, with the rest of the building being occupied by leiden university.[21] originally the ministry of the interior's headquarters at schedeldoekshaven 200, the wijnhaven building, named after the historic wijnhavenkwartier, was converted into campus the hague in 2016.[22]

in 2023, tu delft announced plans to further expand its footprint in the hague by launching a joint university facility with leiden university at spui,  set to open in 2025.[23] this new location is expected to accommodate around 600 tu delft students in the city centre of the hague.[23]

tu delft comprises eight faculties.[24] these are (official dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets):

since 2004, the tu delft education system is divided into three tiers: the bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate. the academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from september until january and the second semester from the end of january until july. most of the lectures are available through opencourseware.

as of 2016[update] tu delft offers 16 bsc programmes.[25] tu delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. the test project finalizes the bsc studies. all bsc programmes are taught in dutch, except for aerospace engineering, applied earth sciences, nanobiology, and computer science, which are taught entirely in english, and electrical engineering which is taught in a mixture of both.

tu delft offers around 40 msc programmes.[26] the msc studies take two years to complete.

tu delft uses the european credit transfer system, where each year msc students are required to obtain 60 ects points. an honours track exists for motivated msc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in dutch grading scale) and did not fail any courses. this track, associated with 30 ects points, is taken alongside the regular msc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of technology in society. the honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the msc programme.

msc programmes are also offered through the 3tu federation, erasmus mundus programmes, idea league joint msc programs and qutech academy.

doctoral studies at tu delft are divided into two phases. the first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. the candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. the research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a doctoral thesis. the thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of tu delft professors and external opponents. once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.

in contrast to us graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving tas form only a small portion of the programme.

the doctoral defense is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. it lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two paranymphs, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. the defense is ended by the pedel, who enters the room and says in latin hora est (it is time), stamping the university staff on the floor. the committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the laudation praising the new doctor. the entire ceremony is chaired by the rector or a representative.

tu delft also offers professional doctorate in engineering.

tu delft has three officially recognized research institutes: research institute for the built environment,[27] international research centre for telecommunications-transmission and radar,[28] and reactor institute delft.[29] in addition to those three institutes, tu delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the delft institute of microelectronics and submicron technology,[30] kavli institute of nanoscience,[31] materials innovation institute,[32] astrodynamics and space missions,[33] delft university wind energy research institute,[34]
tu delft safety and security institute,[35] and the delft space institute,[36] delft institute of applied mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. a complete list of research schools is available on tu delft website.[8]

important part of dutch university system are research schools. they combine education, training and research for phd candidates and postdoctoral researchers in a given field. the main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. research schools of tu delft cooperate with other universities in the netherlands. research schools are required to have an accreditation of royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences. tu delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. the full list of research schools affiliated with tu delft is available on tu delft website,[8] see for example trail research school.

during an academic year the tu delft publishes a weekly magazine: delta,[37] which aims at the student and employee community of the university. the newspaper is predominantly in dutch, with the last few pages published in english. tu delta is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the internet. articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. the weekly agenda including phd promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.

also, approximately four times a year, the tu delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called delft outlook.[38] delft outlook is published in english, while the same content is published in dutch in delft integraal magazine. both magazines present interviews with tu delft researchers, university officials. columns by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published phd theses.

tu delft is governed by the executive board (college van bestuur),[3] controlled and advised by student council, workers council, board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, deans of each tu delft faculty, and directors of tu delft research centers, research schools and research institutes.[39]

executive board is chaired academically by the rector magnificus. the currently appointed rector magnificus, tim van der hagen, has held the position since 2018.[40] he replaced prof. ir. karel ch.a.m. luyben[3] who was rector for the period 2010 to 2018. previous rectors of tu delft include prof. k.f. wakker (1993–1997 and 1998–2002), prof. j. blauwendraad (1997–1998) and prof. j.t. fokkema (2002–2010). executive board is accountable to the supervisory board, appointed by the minister of education, culture and science. one of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.

board of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, research fellows as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. board of doctorates appoints supervisors for phd students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers phd and doctorate honoris causa degrees. committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the s. the committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.

student life at tu delft is organized around numerous student societies and corporations. they can be generally categorized into professional societies, social societies and sport societies. more than half of tu delft students belong to an officially recognized society[1].

there are two student parties at tu delft: oras[41] (organisatie rationele studenten) and lijst bèta (successor of aag).[42]  aag (afdeling actie groepen) started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then polytechnic institute delft. oras became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to aag. after already taking a break from the yearly elections in 2008, aag did not participate anymore in the elections of 2010 due to disappointing results.[43] in 2011, a new party was established, lijst bèta, that got 2 out of the 10 seats in the student counsil.[44] since then, lijst bèta and oras compete each year for seats in tu delft's students council (studenten raad). further, all student organizations of tu delft are associated with the council of student societies delft vera (de verenigingsraad) and the society for study and student matters delft vssd (vereniging voor studie- en studentenbelangen delft).
